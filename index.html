            Jorge Diaz-Rullo has done the third ascent of Papa Oso 8C (B+) in
            Torrelodones. "I've had a lot of things trying and I've had to
            change my method several times. Between 8b + and 8c but no idea."

            Janja and Tomoa won the Combined WCH rather superior meanwhile Adam
            was #18 partly as he touched a bolt in Lead. It should be mentioned
            that Alex Megos won the qualification in a surperior style where
            Tomoa actually was just #3, after Jakob Schubert who was runner-up.

            It is easy to lose power in your lower hand as you look up and put
            all your focus on sticking the next hold. Try this experiment; Look
            at the fingers of your lower hand, and lock off. You will be
            surprised as you can lock off higher when you just concentrate on
            the lower hand instead of focusing on grabbing the next hold. Once
            you have learnt the technique you can start going for the next hold.
